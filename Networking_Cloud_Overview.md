# Networking & Cloud Overview

## Overview
This document provides a high-level overview of networking concepts and cloud infrastructure, aimed at demonstrating understanding of IT support in SaaS and cloud environments.

## Networking Basics

### DNS (Domain Name System)
- Translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses.
- Critical for internet connectivity and SaaS application access.

### DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
- Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on a network.
- Ensures seamless network connectivity without manual configuration.

### VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- Creates a secure connection between a user and a private network over the internet.
- Essential for remote access to corporate resources.

## Cloud Overview

### AWS Key Components
- **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** Virtual servers in the cloud.
- **IAM (Identity & Access Management):** Manages users, roles, and permissions securely.
- **Security Groups:** Acts as virtual firewalls controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

### Cloud vs On-Prem Support
- **Cloud:** Remote troubleshooting, SaaS application support, user account and permission management.
- **On-Prem:** Physical hardware access, network cabling, server maintenance.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Understanding of core networking protocols
- Familiarity with cloud infrastructure and AWS components
