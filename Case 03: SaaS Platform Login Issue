**Date:** 24 Dec 2025  
**Client:** ExampleCorp SaaS  
**Support Type:** Technical Support - Account/Login  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Resolved

## Problem
Client reported that multiple users were unable to log into the platform. They received a generic "Invalid credentials" error despite entering correct usernames and passwords.

---

## Investigation
- Verified the error by creating a test account.
- Checked authentication logs on the backend.
- Identified an expired SSL certificate on the authentication server.
- Noted that session tokens were not being generated correctly due to outdated API calls in the login module.

---

## Actions Taken
1. Renewed SSL certificate for the authentication server.
2. Updated API calls in the login module to match current authentication endpoints.
3. Tested multiple accounts to ensure login success.
4. Communicated updates to the client and provided instructions to clear browser cache.

---

## Outcome
- All users able to log in successfully.
- No further reports of login issues after 24 hours.
- Follow-up scheduled in 48 hours to ensure stability.

---

## Notes / Learnings
- Importance of monitoring SSL expiry dates proactively.
- Implemented automated reminders for certificate renewal.
- Backend API changes should be tested in staging before deployment to production.
